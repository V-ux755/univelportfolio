            <h2>Classifications of Food Webpage</h2>
        
            <p>In this project, I developed a simple HTML webpage detailing the classifications of food: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The webpage uses semantic HTML, CSS for basic styling, and multimedia elements such as images and an embedded video to explain the nutritional roles of each food class. Although not designed to be responsive, this assignment highlights my ability to structure content effectively using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>This project explores the different classes of food, using HTML and CSS to present information on carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. You can view the source code and the project files on my GitHub repository by clicking the link below.</p>

            <h2>CSS Specificity Project: Country Flags</h2>
        
            <p>In this project, I explored CSS specificity by applying gradient backgrounds to various sections, each representing the flag of a different country. Using pseudo-classes, I designed sections for Nigeria, Japan, Gambia, Gabon, France, Belgium, and Germany, ensuring that each section visually captures the distinct colors and patterns of the respective flags. This assignment highlights my understanding of CSS selectors and my ability to create engaging, themed designs.</p>

            <h2>HTML Data Table: Planets of Our Solar System</h2>
        
            <p>
                In this project, I created an HTML data table to present key facts and figures about the planets in our solar system. The table includes a well-structured header and body, ensuring that all planet names and data are organized semantically with appropriate row and column headings. This exercise highlights my ability to use HTML elements effectively, including attributes for enhancing accessibility and a clear visual layout.
